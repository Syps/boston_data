# boston_data [_`Old`_]
This repository contains data files, jupyter notebook, and original front end code for [https://nicksypteras.com/boston-data](https://nicksypteras.com/boston-data).

A rebuilt, React version of this project, the one that's used on the site linked to above, can be found [here](https://github.com/Syps/boston_data_react).

I used some of [Mike Bostok's](https://bost.ocks.org/mike/) examples to make the non-map charts.
